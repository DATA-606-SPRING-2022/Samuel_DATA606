# **Capstone Notebooks**

This directory contains all the notebooks (done using Google Colaboratory) use to bring about my final project.


- (EDA_Hugging_Face)[https://github.com/skbetz54/Samuel_DATA606/blob/main/Notebooks/EDA_Hugging_Face.ipynb] - This notebook is where all my exploratory data analysis is kept. It is focused on the dataset obtained from huggingface.co used to create my deep learning models. 
- (Machine Learning Implementation)[https://github.com/skbetz54/Samuel_DATA606/blob/main/Notebooks/Machine_Learning_Implementation.ipynb] - This notebook is where I trained and tested my deep learning models. It also includes much of the data preprocessing steps necessary to implement these models. 
- (Web_Scrape_CNN)[https://github.com/skbetz54/Samuel_DATA606/blob/main/Notebooks/Web_Scrape_CNN.ipynb] - This notebook contains all the steps taken to obtain, clean, and prepare real-world news articles from CNN to be predicted upon with the models created in the Machine Learning Implementation notebook.
- (Web_Scrape_Fox_News)[https://github.com/skbetz54/Samuel_DATA606/blob/main/Notebooks/Web_Scrape_Fox_News.ipynb] - Similar to Web_Scrape_CNN, this notebook contains all the steps taken to obtain, clean, and prepare real-world news articles from Fox News.
