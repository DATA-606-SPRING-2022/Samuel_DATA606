*An analysis on the amount of fear that plays into current US news media by Samuel Kolodrubetz*

This readme file is going to be a file to update viewers on the current state of my capstone project. It will be continually updated to reflect the new work that I've been doing, each denoted by the date of the release (a.k.a. the turn in date of the deliverables). If you are looking for the project proposal (which will be available here after the conclusion of the project), please follow [this link](https://github.com/skbetz54/Samuel_DATA606/blob/main/Approved_Proposal.md)
